Now it's time to flex your critical evaluation skills. Read the following descriptions of

an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do

to correct them.

    1.    The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't
    very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.
    " They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor
    Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together"
    slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only
    5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger"
    is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

    The 50 droids may not have a strong presentative to overall population either only 50 andoids 
	nor non-droids population The test should include those

    2.    In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar
    Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with
    the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn
     that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their
     attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their
     attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because
     he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar J
     ar to be their representative in the future.
     
	 Sample Randomness Bias: sending to friendly planets should receive higher mark than unfriendly planets. 
	 Jar Jar and Mace Windu should send to 2 friendly and 2 friendly planet for this test.

    3.    A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction
    rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are
    concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites.
    The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction
    for HR and for IT and present the report.
    
	Sample Randomness Bias: Similar to Q2 where those 3 countries may have high satisfaction environment
	which produce higher satisfaction result. The test may want to test satisfaction by country level.

    4.    When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data
    collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company
    for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app
    is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise
     steadily.
     
	 Sample Randomness Bias: People install the app has intentionally to work out more no better rather 
	 they install it or not.

    5.    To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions
    together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C.
    As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds
    that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C.
    She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

The teacher assumes that the 3 copies of exams were random distributed. There is situation where students and who seat next to them had the same exam.
