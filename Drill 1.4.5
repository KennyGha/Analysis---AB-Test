Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of an RFC for an improved version 
of that experiment.

The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger,"
isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, 3
"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two 
groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine 
delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Dark Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 
20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 
droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is 
a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.


The problem
How to increases the recruiting rate


The potential solution
Adding slogan to the group


The method of testing the solution

Split two group of people and each give a slogan and test which team has higher conversion rate as result
